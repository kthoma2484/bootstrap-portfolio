                    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">I'm a native of the Midwest from the amazing city of Chicago, IL. During my formative years, I acquired my primary education in Altheimer and Pine Bluff, AR graduating from Pine Bluff High in 2002. The summer of that year, I moved back to my hometown of Chicago where I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science with prior aspirations of attending medical school to follow. However, in the course of preparing for what the carrer expected of me, I discovered being a clinical physician was not quite where my interests lay. So, what was next? A flight to London with a two year stay abroad while completing my Master's degree in Biomedical Research. Afterwards, I returned to Chicago once again and began my journey as a fully independent, student loan burdened, professional career woman.</p>

                    <p class="mb-3 mt-3 text-justify">My professional career began in graduated education. During that time, I gained invaluable experience in healthcare administration with exposure to various medical programs. In the years to follow, I explored careers geared towards gaining knowledge and experience in research, healthcare admin, and project coordination. In 2014, I relocated to San Diego, CA where I continued working in research. Though I had enjoyed many years of working in research, I found that my interest in clinical research had become less engaging or fullfilling. That's when my search for an new goal began and after much consideration of various new career options, I found that computer coding was of the greatest appeal. The most attractive aspect of programming for me is the logic, reasoning, and challenge of problem solving. This refreshing journey holds promise of a fullfilling and challenging career with endless opportunity to grow and learn.</p>
